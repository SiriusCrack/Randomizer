# Randomizer
Tool to help with decision-making.

Takes a list of items sorted decreasingly by preference, and returns one random item, weighted by that preference.

## Usage
Input should be a series of items as plain text separated by lines, terminated by an empty line.

```
itemA
itemB
itemC

```

Items will be weighted by their precedence in the list.
